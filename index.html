The NGINX team wanted a web presence that was clean and professional, yet conveyed a certain playfulness and sense of fun. We designed and developed a flexible and attractive site, with layout, typography, infographics, and illustrations. The site is completely responsive and displays well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="project-page eros-page"><div class="bg-image eros-image js-toggle-description"></div><div class="description js-description js-toggle-description"><div class="description-text"><div class="description-text-box"><h1>FOS apps</h1><p>I designed this trio of concept apps for the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/erogear/fos-a-truly-wearable-bluetooth-led-display-system">Eros Fos Kickstarter</a>. Fos is a flexible LED display that can be sewn into clothing, and I was tasked with designing three apps to show what it could be used for.</p><p>Joggly is a fitness tracking app that shows the user stats about their run, as well as playing music. It connects to the Fos display to display stats and animations while the user is exercising.</p><p>Sparklemotion is a dance app. It allows the user to select from a range of music visualizations. The selected visualization is then displayed on Fos.</p><p>Cyclomatic is a cycling app which shows the user the best route to take, as well as providing synchronized turn signals on the Fos display to improve safety while biking.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="project-page hypothesis-page"><div class="bg-image hypothesis-image js-toggle-description"></div><div class="description js-description js-toggle-description"><div class="description-text"><div class="description-text-box"><h1>Hypothesis</h1><p><a href="http://hypothes.is/what-is-it/">Hypothesis</a> is a non profit organization building a distributed, open source platform for the collaborative evaluation of information. Right now, this consists of a tool to annotate websites, books, and academic papers.</p><p>These annotations are visible to anyone else who has the extension installed. A reputation system lets users vote on and flag annotations, bringing the best to the top. This will allow people to collaborate on and extend any information online, calling out inaccuracies at their source, and improving the internet for everyone. </p><p>I designed the entire interface from scratch, iterating through hundreds of mockups and sketches and writing all of the html/css and some of the Javascript. I focused on making what could have been a complex and unwieldy interface into something minimal, simple, and easy. I also handled the organization’s web presence, designing the main informational site and blog, as well as several websites for conferences and events organized by Hypothesis.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="project-page chronometer-page"><div class="bg-image chronometer-image js-toggle-description"></div><div class="description js-description js-toggle-description"><div class="description-text"><div class="description-text-box"><h1>Chronometer</h1><p>Most clocks on smartphones require at least three steps to even set a simple timer. I wanted to change this with a one touch interface.</p><p>The user is able to set timers and alarms by touching and dragging on either the minute or hour hands. A pointer detaches and is dropped at the time the user wants the timer or alarm to sound (the minute hand pointer sets the timer and the hour hand sets the row).</p><p>Chronometer syncs with the user’s calendar to get the user’s appointments. The appointments are displayed around the edge of the clockface as semitransparent arcs. A touch on one of the arcs pops the details of the calendar item over the clockface.
